### How to run?
1. ```yarn install```
2. ```yarn dev```

To build: ```yarn build```

### What I've done:
That was a fun thing to do, I made sure to consider following things:
- Establish clear extendable production-like arcitecture
- Provide an easy way to create customizable and reliable ui-components (@mui/base)
- Attempted to following best-practices with UI: loading on demand, responsiveness (wallet alerts, erros handling)
- Usable on mobile devices up to 320px
- Used battle-tested tech stack (react, redux, styled-components, typescript)
- Used Vite for quicker and smoother developer experience
- Established flexible styling system, based on CSS variables.
- Established strong static-analysis, ensuring codebase health and consistency.
- Encapsulated APIs in SDK-like format

### What could have been improved (skipped cuz it's time-consuming):
- I18n support (localization)
- More detailed ui-components, stronger aligned with design-system
- Better and more efficient/flexible abstraction over subragh
